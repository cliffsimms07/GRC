# Start Here

Welcome to an AI Agent Coordination repository. This project is dedicated to creating an enterprise-scale framework for reliably generating value in AI agent tasks, grounded in familiar concepts from industry and academia in coordinating human agents. We focus on establishing a structured approach where AI agents can operate within disciplined, GRC-aligned parameters. This repo focuses on defining behavioral expectations and alignment requirements in the context of economic and commercial pursuits. 

## GRC Framework

We draw inspiration from the typical Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) models, repurposing these concepts for AI agent coordination. See tbd **GRC Framework** files for more details.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to this project. If you're interested in contributing, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Contribution Standards**: Guidelines are being developed.
- **Pull Requests**: You are encouraged to submit pull requests with a comprehensive description of changes and references to any pertinent issues.
- **Issue Reporting**: For any issues encountered, please provide detailed descriptions to facilitate resolution.

## Key Concepts

1. **Documentation Standards**: All agent activities are predicated on documented expectations and generate discoverable information. See tbd **Documentation Standards** files for more details.
2. **Decision-Making Process**: All agent decisions must consider documented information and align with the established framework. Details in tbd **Decision-Making Standards** files for more details.
3. **Planning and Implementation**: All agent actions should follow a structured plan. Guidelines can be found in tbd **Planning and Implementation Standards** files for more details.
4. **Action and Compliance**: All agents should take steps for effective implementation, communication, and compliance as outlined in tbd **Action and Compliance Protocols**.
5. **Monitoring and Improvement**: Regular monitoring and updating of processes are vital. Strategies are detailed in tbd **Monitoring and Improvement Strategies**.

We hope this framework guides you in coordinating AI agents effectively. Please contact us through the repository's issues section for any questions or suggestions.
