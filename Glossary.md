Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) constitute a comprehensive strategy adopted by businesses to effectively oversee and synchronize their activities with regulatory mandates, industry benchmarks, and internal guidelines. This cohesive framework comprises three essential elements: governance, encompassing the creation of decision-making protocols and structures for accountability; risk management, dedicated to identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential organizational threats; and compliance, ensuring adherence to pertinent laws and regulations. By integrating these components, GRC empowers organizations to navigate complex regulatory landscapes, foster transparent decision-making, and establish a culture of accountability, promoting resilience and sustainability in their operations amid dynamic business environments.
